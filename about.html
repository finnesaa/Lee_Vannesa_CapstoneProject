                <h2>About Smile School</h2>
                <p>At Smile School, we teach kids why brushing and flossing are so important for keeping teeth healthy and strong.
                   Every day, tiny bits of food and bacteria stick to your teeth and form <strong>plaque</strong> — a sticky film that can
                   cause cavities and gum problems if not cleaned away. Brushing twice a day and flossing once a day helps protect your
                   teeth, gums, and even your overall health!
                </p>
